Minesweeper
===========

Minesweeper is a classic logic game. Reveal safe cells, avoid mines, and mark all
mines with flags to win. The game runs inside a popup window and supports both
terminal and GUI Vim.

Installation
============

Requirements~

This plugin requires Vim 9.0 or later with Vim9 script support enabled.
It will not work with Neovim or older versions of Vim.

Installation~

Using Git~
If you have git installed, run the following command in your terminal:

    Unix/Linux/macOS: >
      git clone https://github.com/yegappan/minesweeper.git ~/.vim/pack/downloads/opt/minesweeper
<
    Windows (cmd.exe): >
      git clone https://github.com/yegappan/minesweeper.git %USERPROFILE%\vimfiles\pack\downloads\opt\minesweeper
<
Using a ZIP file~
If you prefer not to use Git:

    Unix/Linux/macOS:
    1. Create the destination directory: >

	 mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/downloads/opt/
<
    2. Download the plugin ZIP file from GitHub and extract its contents into
       the directory created above.

       *Note:* GitHub usually names the extracted folder minesweeper-main.
       Rename it to minesweeper so the final path looks like this: >

	 ~/.vim/pack/downloads/opt/minesweeper/
	 ├── plugin/
	 ├── autoload/
	 └── doc/
<
    Windows (cmd.exe):
    1. Create the destination directory: >

	 if not exist "%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles\pack\downloads\opt" mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles\pack\downloads\opt"
<
    2. Download the plugin ZIP file from GitHub and extract its contents into
       that directory.

       *Note:* Rename the extracted folder (usually minesweeper-main) to
       minesweeper so the path matches: >

	 %USERPROFILE%\vimfiles\pack\downloads\opt\minesweeper\
	 ├── plugin/
	 ├── autoload/
	 └── doc/

Finalizing Setup~
Since this plugin is installed in the opt (optional) directory, it will not
load automatically. Add the following line to your .vimrc (Unix) or _vimrc
(Windows): >

    packadd minesweeper
<
After adding the line, restart Vim and run the following command to enable the
help documentation: >

    :helptags ALL
<
Plugin Manager Installation~

If using a plugin manager like vim-plug, add to your .vimrc or init.vim:
>
    Plug 'path/to/minesweeper'
<
Then run `:PlugInstall` and `:helptags ALL`

For other plugin managers (Vundle, Pathogen, etc.), follow their standard
installation procedures for local plugins.
